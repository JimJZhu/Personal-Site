She should consider incentives such as offering time off withpay, a bonus, and recognition for Ming.92)Discuss several options as to who should conduct performance appraisals, and discuss one strength of eachoption.Answer:Supervisors' ratings are relatively easy to prepare and he/she should be in a good position to observe andevaluate.Peers are effective in predicting future management success.- ratings tend to be more reliable, fair, and valid.- ratings are used in conjunction with those from supervisors but studies show employees ratethemselves high.- ratings of their managers are valuable when used for developmental rather than evaluative purposes.360-degree appraisals support the activities of performance feedback, coaching, leadership development,succession planning, and rewards and recognition.25
