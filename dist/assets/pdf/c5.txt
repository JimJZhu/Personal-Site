Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.95)You are the HR professional responsible for Human Resources Planning (HRP) at Dineromucha Inc., aCanadian credit union. You will be implementing the nominal group technique for forecasting human resourcesneeds. What should you be aware of regarding the advantages and disadvantages of this technique?Answer:The advantages of this technique include involvement of key decision makers, a future focus, and the factthat the group discussion can facilitate the exchange of ideas and greater acceptance of results.Disadvantages include: subjectivity and the potential for group pressure to lead to less accurateassessment than could be obtained through other ways.2696)What are the factors that should be considered when forecasting the number and type of people needed to meetthe organization's objectives?Answer:· the demand for the organization's product or service· projected turnover as a result of resignations or termination· quality and nature of employees in relation to what management sees as the changing needs of theorganization· decisions to upgrade the quality of products or services or enter into new markets, which might changethe required employee skill mix· planned technological and administrative changes aimed at increasing productivity and reducingemployee headcount· the financial resources available to each department.97)Explain what the Delphi Technique is, and what steps are involved in this process.Answer:· It is useful for long-range forecasting and other strategic planning issues.· It typically involves outside experts as well as company employees, based on the premise that outsidersmay be able to assess changes and their potential impact more objectively.· There are several steps involved in the process, including:1.Problem identification–each group member must submit a potential solution by completing aquestionnaire; direct face-to-face contact is not permitted2. After the questionnaire is completed independently and anonymously, theresults are compiled at acentralized location.3. A copy of theresults isgiven to each member of the team.4. If there are differences in opinion, each individual uses the feedback from other experts tofine-tunehis or her independent assessment.5. The last 2 steps are repeated as often as necessary until a consensus is reached.98)Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the Delphi Technique.Answer:The advantages include: involvement of key decision makers and future focus. The technique permits thegroup to critically evaluate a wide range of views. Disadvantages include the fact that judgments maynot use objective data efficiently, the time and costs involved, and the potential difficulty in integratingdiverse opinions.2799)Briefly describe the tools and techniques used to forecast the supply of internal candidates.Answer:Some firms use theMarkov analysis technique to track the pattern of employee movements throughvarious jobs and develop a transitional probability matrix for forecasting internal supply by specificcategories, such as position and gender. Such an analysis shows the actual number (and percentage) ofemployees who remain in each job from one year to the next, as well as the proportions promoted,demoted, transferred, and leaving the organization. These proportions (probabilities) are then used toforecast human resources supply.Skills inventories contain comprehensive information about the capabilities of current employees.Prepared manually or using a computerized system, data gathered for each employee include name, age,date of employment, current position, present duties and responsibilities, educational background,previous work history, skills, abilities and interests. Information about current performance andreadiness for promotion is generally included as well. Data pertaining to managerial staff are compiled inamanagement inventory. In addition to the information listed above, such inventories include thenumber and types of employees supervised, duties of such employees, total budget managed, previousmanagerial duties and responsibilities, and managerial training received.Replacement charts are a visual representation of who will replace whom in the event of a job opening.Many employers use such charts to keep track of potential internal candidates for their most importantpositions. Such charts typically indicate age and replacement status of potential internal candidates,based on two variables: present performance and promotability. Replacement charts provide an excellentquick reference tool, they contain very little information. For that reason, many firms prefer to usereplacement summaries. Such summaries list likely replacements for each position and their relativestrengths and weaknesses, as well as information about current position, performance, promotability, ageand experienceSuccession planning is the process used to ensure a suitable supply of successors for current and futuresenior or key jobs, so that the careers of individuals can be effectively planned and managed. Activitiesinvolved include: analysis of the demand for managers and professional by company level, function andskill; audit of existing executives and projection of likely future supply from internal and externalsources; planning of individual career paths; career counseling; accelerated promotions, withdevelopment targeted against the future needs of the business; performance-related training anddevelopment; planned strategic recruitment; and the actual activities by which openings are filled.100)You are the V.P. Human Resources at a major Canadian automaker which has been significantly impacted bythe recent recession. Briefly describe the major strategies available to you to deal with the labour surplus at thefirm.Answer:You could initially respond to such a situation by implementing ahiring freeze, which means thatopenings are filled by reassigning current employees, and no outsiders are hired unless authorization isgranted by the CEO due to extenuating circumstances.

Some organizations attempt to accelerate attrition by offering incentives to employees to leave,such asbuyout andearly retirement programs.There are a number of strategies to reduce the total number of hours worked. Included arejob sharing,which involves dividing the duties of a single position between two or more employees; reducingfull-time positions topart-time work; instituting awork-sharing arrangement, whereby employeeswork three or four days a week and collect Employment Insurance on their non-work day(s); and placingemployees on areduced work week, which involves employees working fewer hours and receiving lesspay.It may be necessary for the firm to place employees onlayoff. This involves the temporary withdrawal ofemployment to workers for economic or business reasons. Layoffs may be of relatively short duration, ormay last months or even years.When employees are no longer required by the organization, the employment relationship may bepermanently severed. This is known astermination. You should consider severance pay obligations andsupplying outplacement assistance.28101)Differentiate between trend analysis, ratio analysis, and regression analysis.Answer:Trend analysis involves studying the firm's employment levels over a period of years to predict futureneeds. The purpose is to identify employment trends that might continue into the future. Becauseemployment levels rarely depend solely on the passage of time, but rather on factors such as changes insales volume and productivity, trend analysis can only provide an initial estimateRatio analysis involves making estimates based on the ratio between (1) some causal factor (such as salesvolume) and (2) number of employees required. Like trend analysis, ratio analysis assumes thatproductivity remains about the same. Thus, ratio analysis can only provide an approximation of futureHR needs.Regression analysis is a more sophisticated statistical technique that involves the use of a mathematicalformula to project future demands based on an established relationship between (1) an organization'semployment level (dependent variable) and (2) some measurable factor of output (independent variable)such as revenue, sales, or production level. Where there are several dependent and/or independentvariables, multiple regression analysis is used.102)You are the HR professional responsible for Human Resources Planning (HRP) at a major Canadian insuranceprovider, Bonnvue Inc.

You will be implementing the nominal group technique for forecasting human resourcesneeds. Cite and explain the steps you will follow.Answer:The steps are as follows:· Each member of the group independently writes down his or her ideas on the problem or issue.· Going around the table, each member then presents one idea.· This process continues until all ideas have been presented and recorded, typically on a flipchart.· No discussion is permitted during this step.· Clarification is then sought, followed by group discussion and evaluation.· Finally, each member is asked to rank the ideas.· This is done independently and in silence.30
