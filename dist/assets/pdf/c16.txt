Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.88)Describe the purposes of a grievance procedure.Answer:The primary purpose of a grievance procedure is to ensure the application of the contract with a degreeof justice for both parties. There are a number of related, secondary purposes, as well:â€¢ providing the opportunity for the interpretation of contract language, such as the meaning of "sufficientability."â€¢ serving as a communications device, through which managers can become aware of employee concernsand areas of dissatisfaction.â€¢ bringing to the attention of the union leaders, management leaders, or both, those areas of the contractrequiring clarification or modification in subsequent negotiations.89)Discuss the impact of unionization on HRM.Answer:Organizational Structureâ€“Once an organization is unionized, the HR department is typically expandedby the addition of an LR specialist or section. In a large firm with a number of bargaining units, humanresources and labour relations may form two divisions within a broader department, often calledindustrial relations or labour relations.Management Decision Makingâ€“Union leaders are typically involved in decisions pertaining to anyissues that will affect bargaining unit members, such as subcontracting of work, productivity standards,and job content. While management continues to claim exclusive rights over certain matters, unionleaders may challenge these rights.Centralization of Record Keeping and Standardization of Decision Makingâ€“Unionization generallyresults in greater centralization of employee record keeping and standardization of decision making toensure equity, consistency, and uniformity. More centralized coordination is typically required in theenforcement of HR policies and procedures, for example, which creates an expanded role for members ofthe LR department, as does the increased need for documentation to support decisions.Supervisory Authority and Responsibilityâ€“The major impact of unionization is at the first-line level,since it is the supervisors who are responsible for day-to-day contract administration. Greaterstandardization of decision making and centralization of record keeping may lead supervisors to feelthey have lost some of their authority, which can cause resentment, especially since they inevitably findthat unionization results in an increase in their responsibilities.Supervisors are often required to produce more written records than ever before, since documentation iscritical at grievance and arbitration hearings. They must ensure that all of their decisions and actions arein accordance with the terms of the collective agreement. Even decisions that abide by the agreement maybe challenged by the union.2590)Describe the current challenges to the Canadian labour movement and explain how unions are dealing withthem.Answer:Global Competitionâ€“Increased global competition and massive importation of consumer electronics,cars, clothing, textiles, and shoes has led to job losses for Canadian union members. Canadian unionswere highly opposed to NAFTA, claiming Canadian jobs would be lost to low-wage Mexican workers,as well as to the anti-union environment that exists in many U.S. states. Some unions have taken moredirect action. The United Electrical Workers, for example, subsidized organizers at Mexican plants of theU.S.-owned General Electric company.Technological Changeâ€“Technological advances have decreased the effectiveness of strikes in somesectors, because highly automated organizations can remain fully operational with minimal staffinglevels during work stoppages. Even more significant is the fact that improvements in computertechnology have lowered the demand for many blue-collar workers, and resulted in a decline in unionmembership in the auto, steel, and other manufacturing industries. E-commerce work (such asprocessing credit card claims) is highly portable, and can be shifted, almost literally, at the touch of abutton from one centre to anotherâ€“even overseas. To deal with such threats, some unions have negotiatedcollective agreement protection for workers whose skills are threatened by technological obsolescence.Privatization and the Unionization of White-collar Employees, Managers, and Professionals â€“In thepast, many white-collar employees tended to identify more with owners or managers than with theirblue-collar colleagues, often enjoying certain privileges and status symbols available to salariedemployees only. Because the improvements in pay, benefits, and working conditions that werenegotiated by the union representing their blue-collar coworkers were often extended to them as amatter of course, there was little perceived need to unionize. In recent years, however, the growth in thesize of many public- and private-sector organizations has tended to distance them from management,which has made unionization more attractive. Increasing difficulties in attempting to resolve grievances,combined with a lack of job security related to downsizing in all sectors, as well as the privatization ofservices ranging from hydro to home care, has also led to increased interest in unionization amongwhite-collar workers.In response to the threats to job security posed by downsizing, privatization, and public-privatepartnerships, and the decrease in membership numbers associated with the decline in blue-collar jobs,unions started to increase their efforts to organize white-collar employees. Service-orientedorganizations, such as insurance agencies, banks, retail stores, fast-food chains, and governmentagencies, have been targeted for organizing campaigns. Even small businesses are being organized. Toattract white-collar employees, unions have changed their focus and bargaining priorities. In addition tofocussing more on equity and family issues, unions are also capitalizing on the health and safety risksassociated with white-collar jobs, such as the effects of working at video display terminals for longperiods of time, and the potential for repetitive strain injury associated with the jobs of clerical workersand cashiers.Another group that has been targeted for unionization includes managers and professionals. Ofparticular appeal to these employees is the unions' desire to protect the job security of those represented,something that has been seriously threatened due to extensive downsizing in both public- andprivate-sector organizations.Innovative Workplace Practicesâ€“In workplaces in which employees participate in decision making, havea high degree of autonomy and little supervision, and are paid based on their performance or theknowledge/skills they have attained, there may be less perceived need for a union. Some individualsargue that such innovative workplace practices as semi-autonomous work teams, skill-based pay, profitsharing and employee stock ownership plans undermine union power by coopting employees andaligning employee interests with those of management. On the other hand, in workplaces in which theunions have supported such changes, the end result may be better communication and more cooperation,a win-win situation.2691)Amin is the new VP of Labour Relations at a telecomminications company which has a history of poorlabour-management relations. Describe the strategies you recommend he use to assist in building an effectiveand more positive labour-management relationship.Answer:Instituting an open-door policyâ€“When the key managers involved in labour-management relationswelcome employees into their office a to discuss any problems or concerns, and employees feelcomfortable in doing so, many issues: can be resolved informally. For example, if the president of thelocal knows that he or she can approach the LR manager "off the record" and that anything discussed insuch sessions will be kept strictly confidential, fewer grievances and a more trusting and harmoniousrelationship often result.Extending the courtesy of prior consultationâ€“While every management decision does not require unionapproval, if any actions that might affect union members are discussed with the union executive first, thelikelihood of grievances is greatly reduced.Demonstrating genuine concern for employee well-beingâ€“When managers are genuinely concernedabout employee well-being, and demonstrate that concern, mutual trust and respect are oftenestablished. This involves fair treatment and communication going well above and beyond therequirements of the collective agreement.Forming joint study committeesâ€“Forming labour/management committees to investigate and resolvecomplex issues can lead to innovative and creative solutions, as well as a better relationship.Holding joint training programsâ€“When a contract is first signed, it can be beneficial to hold a jointtraining program to ensure that supervisors and union stewards are familiar with the terms andconditions specified therein and understand the intent of the negotiating teams. Such training can reducemisunderstandings and the likelihood of disagreement regarding interpretation of contract language.Joint training programs can also be extremely helpful in building the cooperation necessary to deal moreeffectively with other employment-related issues of concern to both parties, such as employee health andsafety.Meeting regularlyâ€“Whether required by the collective agreement or voluntarily instituted, regularlyscheduled union-management meetings can result in more effective communication and the resolutionof problems/concerns before they become formal grievance issues.Using third-party assistanceâ€“To build a better relationship, it is often beneficial to bring in a consultantor a government agency representative to help identify common goals and objectives and ways in whichtrust and communication can be strengthened.92)Differentiate between interest arbitration and rights arbitration and explain the use of each.Answer:Interest arbitration involves the use of an outside third party to impose the terms of a collectiveagreement.
