Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.69)You are the Director of HR at Targus Inc., a Canadian sportswear retailer with 1000 employees. Discuss reasonswhy you would choose to implement a stand-alone system rather than an enterprise-wide system.Answer:An HRIS can be a stand-along system, because not all organizations require sophisticatedenterprise-wide systems such as SAP or Oracle. The reasons that would drive an organization to decideon a stand-alone system would be cost, number of employees, the degree of efficiency and the company'sexisting hardware and software.An effective HRIS requires a balance between what it can do from a technical perspective and how it canmeet the needs of that organization. These needs usually tend to increase as the size of the companygrows. Smaller firms typically use very basic software applications such as MS Excel. In addition, smallerfirms are not able to bear the large costs associated with implementing an enterprise-wide system, norwould this be cost effective, since smaller firms would require payroll and benefits administration,time/attendance and employee scheduling functions right from the start. As the size of the companygrows, the data integration requirement grows and, with it, the need to have better backup and recoverycapability. Therefore larger organizations will want to invest in enterprise-wide systems.70)Describe the stages in the evolution of HR technology.Answer:There are four stages in the evolution of HR technology: paper-based systems, early personal computertechnology, electronic databases and web-based technology.Stage 1–Paper-based systemsThese systems operated independently from other business-related functions. Data was typically storedon mainframe computers and HR was the sole custodian of the data. It was common for managers tosend employees to HR to get their "personnel" questions answered.Stage 2–Early personal computer technologyIn this stage data migrated to PCs and local area network systems. These databases were able to producereports that listed basic employee information. HR continued to be the only group who had access to thesystem and continued to be the owner of the data.Stage 3–Electronic database systemsRelational database technology emerged in this stage, which meant that pieces of data could be stored inmore than one file, and they could be connected. With this, HR started to get integrated with otherbusiness-related systems.Stage 4–Web-based technologyThe focus has shifted to automating as many transactions as possible to achieve effectiveness andefficiencies. Web-based applications use a web browser as a user interface. Users can access theapplications from any computer connected to the internet via a secure, password-protected login page.HR still continues to be the owner and custodian of HR information but others have begun to recognizethe value of this information to the business.2171)What is an HRIS? Describe some of its subsystems and key functions.Answer:A Human Resources Information System (HRIS) is an integrated system used to gather, store and analyzeinformation regarding an organization's human resources. There are several components, calledsubsystems that make up an HRIS. They areemployee administration, recruitment,time andattendance,training and development, pension administration, employment equity, performanceevaluation,compensation and benefits administration, organizational management, health and safety,labour relations and payroll. The highlighted subsystems will be discussed.Employee administration–You would find information such as name, hire date, address, telephone, email address, birth date, sex, position titles, and employment status.Time and attendance–Included is information necessary to calculate vacation time, such as hire date andany leaves of absences.Training and development–Includes data on an employee's skills and competencies, training coursestaken, costs of courses, developmental activities and career-planning activities.Compensation and benefits administration–Information regarding the company's compensation andbenefits plans and the policies regarding these plans.72)Describe how the role of HR has evolved in an IT-enabled organization.Answer:The impact of technology has fundamentally changed the role of HR in the organization. It has enabledHR to decrease its involvement in transactional activities, increase its focus on the customer and increaseits delivery of strategic services.Self-services such as ESS and MSS have reduced the administrative burden on HR, since the users canhave direct access to HR-related information. HRIS subsystems have reduced the amount of paperworkand coordination that was previously required of HR. Therefore, HR has more time to spend workingwith its customers (i.e. internal staff, management and other departments) in understanding their needsand providing appropriate solutions. This has also allowed HR to work with senior managementdeveloping and implementing organizational strategy.73)Identify and describe five key technology trends.Answer:1.Enhanced focus on workforce analytics–This focus will require HR to evolve as a 'decision science',providing managers with value-added decision making tools2.Increased use of portals and intranets and a greater focus on the use of virtual tools–HR will berequired to ensure that the organization is aware of the advantages of these tools and providing trainingand education to ease the transition.3.Greater access to technology–This will require HR to ensure that the appropriate security measuresare in place and to be highly diligent in terms of the types of access and who gets access.4.Continued optimization of current systems–Requires HR to be "technologically educated."5.Increased focus on reducing costs–HR will be required to optimize the functionality of HR technology.Other key trends mentioned in the textbook includeincreased use of standards for data exchange andprocesses,contingency planning, andheightened awareness of HR data privacy.2274)What are the key challenges faced by an organization during the selection and implementation phase of anHRIS?Answer:The first challenge for the organization would be to determine (1) how much customization it requiresand (2) what type of system the organization prefers and needs. Based on this, a company can decide topurchase a system that brings in "best practices," or to customize the software to fit the existing processes.The organization on the other hand may want a stand-alone system or an enterprise-wide system.Factors such as company size, projected growth, industry, existing technology, and pricing would becritical areas for consideration. For example, a small company may not require a comprehensive HRIS. Itwould be too costly to maintain such a system and therefore would not be cost effective. Also, if theexisting technology of the company does not support a large system, it may be wise to consider a basicpackage with the option of adding components as the company grows and as the technology becomesmore advanced.In the implementation stage the challenge would be to select a suitable project team to move the projectforward. The project team needs to have a balanced composition in terms of representation from withinthe company, HR, and outside consultants. It also requires running the system in a controlledenvironment before the actual launch. Existing data needs to be converted into the new system and anyglitches should be identified as much as possible during the testing period.75)What are the five key competencies for HR as outlined by the Ulrich model?Answer:The five key competencies are:1. Mastery of HR technology.2. Strategic contribution.3. Business knowledge.4. Personal credibility.5. HR delivery.76)What are the advantages and disadvantages of web-based self-service applications?Answer:Web-based self-service applications include employee self-service systems and managementself-service systems.Employee self-service systems allow employees to update their personal information, such as address,phone number, emergency contact, etc. It also enables employees to view their individual payrollinformation, enroll for benefits programs, and access HR policies and company communications materialsuch as newsletters. Therefore employees no longer need to speak to HR for routine updates.Management self-service allows managers to access a range of information not only about themselvesbut also about the employees who report to them.These systems have helped the HR to reduce operational costs because basic administrative andtransactional activities have been shifted to employees. This has enabled HR to focus more on strategicissues. Because it is an automated service, service levels are enhanced, which has led to increasedemployee satisfaction.Employees and managers can tend to view this new technology as the "work of HR" and therefore resistthe usage of it. The usefulness of such technology also depends on whether the content is consideredbeneficial and relevant to those who are using it. In addition, factors such as how technology-savvy theusers are, user friendliness of the systems and its culture fit within the organization contribute to thesuccessful implementation and usage of the system.23
