In providing reference information, the concept ofqualified privilegeis important.Generallyspeaking, if comments are made in confidence for a public purpose, without malice, and are honestlybelieved, the defence of "qualified privilege" exists. Thus, if honest, fair and candid references are given,then this doctrine generally protects the reference giver, even if negative information is imparted aboutthe candidate. Nevertheless, with the fear of civil litigation increasing, more Canadian companies areadopting a "no reference" policy regarding previous employees or are only willing to confirm theposition held and dates of employment especially in the case of discharged employees.28
