Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.72)Describe the role of ethics in HRM and its challenges and benefits.Answer:The professionalization of HRM has created the need for a uniform code of ethics as one of therequirements of maintaining professional status. CCHRA Code of Ethics provide guidelines foremployees and employers. Increasingly HR is involved in providing ethics training, and monitoring toensure compliance with the code of ethics. Key ethical issues facing Canadian organizations pertain tosecurity of information, employee and client privacy, environmental issues, governance, and conflicts ofinterest.Main reasons for failure to achieve desired outcomes are attributed to lack of leadership and inadequatetraining. Advantages of having an ethics program properly implemented include increased confidenceamong stakeholders, greater client, customer and employee loyalty, decreased vulnerability to crime,reduced losses due to internal theft and increased public trust.73)Describe key HRM issues related to demographic trends and workforce diversity.Answer:Key demographic and diversity issues faced by Canadian organizations include age, education, women,visible minorities, aboriginal people and persons with disabilities.With the baby boomers retiring within the next few decades, Canada is said to be faced with a loomingshortage of skilled workers. On the other hand is the Sandwich Generation, with responsibilities forbringing up children as well as caring for elderly relatives who are no longer capable of functioningindependently. Therefore, organizations are forced to look at HR practices to accommodate the growingneeds and concerns of these employees. For example, some companies have started to provide eldercarebenefits to those who have elderly relatives. Members of Generation X have pushed HR practices toinclude flexible work arrangements and a better work/life balance. Generation Y, who are now beginningto enter the workforce, are known as masters of technology and comfortable with authority and diversity.Organizations are yet again required to make changes to keep this group challenged and to manage theoverall diversity in the workplace. With the level of education increasing amongst the Canadianworkforce, managers are expected to try to ensure that the talents and capabilities of employees are fullyutilized and that opportunities are provided for career growth.Employment for women has steadily increased over the decades, and organizations are accommodatingworking women and shared parenting responsibilities by offering on-site daycare, emergency childcaresupport, and flexible work arrangements. Visible minorities are entering the labour market at a fasterplace than the rest of the population, which poses numerous challenges for employers with increaseddiversity. Employers are required to recognize foreign credentials and be fair in the recruitment andselection process to give opportunities to those who are new to Canada. Persons with disabilities stillcontinue to experience high rates of unemployment and underemployment, and to receive lower pay.2174)Discuss how the impact of HRM on an organization is measured.Answer:HR professionals need to be able to measure the value and impact of their organization's human capitaland HRM practices. Traditional operational measures focused on the size and cost of the HR functionsuch as absenteeism rates and cost per hire, but today's measures need to reflect the quality of people andthe effectiveness of HRM initiatives that build workforce capability.Watson Wayatt developed a Human Capital Index which outlines 30 key HR practices and indicates theircontributions to shareholder value. These 30 practices were summarized into 5 categories–recruitingexcellence, clear rewards and accountability, collegial and flexible workplace, communications integrityand prudent use of resources. Many organizations are using the balanced scorecard approach, whichtranslates into financial results, customers, internal business process and human capital.75)Discuss the responsibilities of Human Resource Management.Answer:Human resources management responsibilities and activities fall into two categories: operationalresponsibilities and strategic responsibilities. Traditionally HR professionals have focused on operationalresponsibilities. However, there is a growing focus on HR taking a more strategic role.Operational responsibilities include activities such as selection and assimilation into the organization,development of capabilities and transition out of the organization. Traditional roles of HR professionalsinclude acting as an in-house consultant, offering advice on HR-related matters, formulating HR policiesand procedures and other HR services. In the recent years most of the administrative/operationalactivities of HR have been outsourced.Strategic responsibilities include getting involved in strategy formulation and execution. HRprofessionals together with line managers undertake environmental scanning, which helps theorganization to identify and analyze internal strengths and weaknesses and external threats andopportunities. HR professionals can provide information about such things as the incentive programsused by competitors, pending legislative changes and impending labour shortages. In terms of executingstrategy, HR professionals act as change agents when organizations go through significant changes suchas mergers, acquisitions, and downsizing. HR also is involved in reducing labour costs by introducingstrategies to reduce turnover, absenteeism and occupational injuries and accidents.76)You have been hired as the Director of Human Resources at a telecommunications company. Defineorganizational culture and climate and explain the importance of each to the company.Answer:Organization culture consists of the core values, beliefs, and assumptions that are widely shared bymembers of an organization. It serves a variety of purposes:· communicating what the organization "believes in" and "stands for"· providing employees with a sense of direction and expected behaviour (norms)· shaping employees' attitudes about themselves, the organization, and their roles· creating a sense of identity, orderliness, and consistency· fostering employee loyalty and commitmentOrganizational climate refers to the prevailing atmosphere that exists in an organization and its impacton employees. The major factors influencing the climate are management's leadership style, HR policiesand practices, and amount and style of communication. The type of climate that exists is generallyreflected in the level of employee motivation, job satisfaction, performance, and productivity, and thushas a direct impact on organizational profits and/or ongoing viability.2277)Discuss the theories that have contributed to the evolution of HRM and the challenges faced.Answer:The evolution of HRM can be discussed through the following theories.Scientific Management: Concern for ProductionThe process of "scientifically" analyzing manufacturing processes, reducing production costs, andcompensating employees based on their performance levels.Human Relations Movement: Concern for PeopleA management philosophy based on the belief that the attitudes and feelings of workers are importantand deserve more attention.The Human Resources Movement: Concern for People and ProductivityA management philosophy focusing on concern for people and productivity.Arriving at this joint focus on people and productivity involved four evolutionary phases.The main reason for this evolution has been economic factors such as globalization, intense competitionand deregulation, which have made human capital more important. Many traditional sources ofcompetitive advantage have become less powerful. Companies are now using human capital to create acompetitive advantage. However, there are number of challenges that slow the progress. HR is stillconsidered a cost-centre by most line and senior management. Many HR professionals also need toacquire more broad-based business knowledge and skill sets and be recognized as equal businesspartners at the decision-making table.23
