Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.77)Explain an employer's duty to provide "reasonable accommodation." Give an example of reasonableaccommodation.Answer:Reasonable accommodation deals with the adjustment of employment policies and practices so that noindividual is denied benefits, disadvantaged in employment, or prevented from carrying out the essentialcomponents of a job on the basis of prohibited grounds of discrimination. This may involve makingadjustments to meet needs based on the group to which an individual belongs, such as scheduleadjustments to accommodate religious beliefs, or on an individual employee basis, such as work stationredesign to enable an individual with a physical disability to perform a particular task.Employers are expected to accommodate to the point of undue hardship, a term for which there is nodefinitive definition. Generally, however, to claim undue hardship, employers must present evidencethat the financial cost of accommodation (even with outside sources of funding) or health and safety risksto the individual concerned or other employees would make accommodation impossible. Factors thatcannot be taken into consideration include business inconvenience, customer preference, or disruption toa collective agreement.Refusing to make every reasonable effort to accommodate employees is a violation of human rightslegislation.An example of reasonable accommodation would be installing an elevator in a government building toaccommodate persons in wheelchairs.2378)Discuss sexual harassment and its impact on employees and the work environment. Provide examples of sexualcoercion and sexual annoyance.Answer:Sexual harassment is defined as offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person's sex aswell as behaviour of a sexual nature that creates an intimidating, unwelcome, hostile or offensive workenvironment. Sexual harassment can be divided into two categories:sexual coercion, which isharassment of a sexual nature that results in some direct consequence to the worker's employment statusor some gain in or loss of tangible job benefits, andsexual annoyance, which is sexually related conductthat is hostile, intimidating or offensive to the employee but has no direct link to tangible job benefits orloss thereof.All types of sexual harassment can have negative impact on employees as well as the work environment.Employees will feel uncomfortable seeing such work conditions, and employee morale and productivitycan be significantly impacted. Absenteeism can increase amongst staff. They will have less and less trustin management if action is not taken. The organization can run the risk of facing legal action forcondoning such behaviours.79)Describe diversity management and what factors act as barriers to diversity management programs.Answer:Diversity management involves a set of activities designed to integrate all members of an organization'smulticultural work force and use their diversity to enhance the firm's effectiveness.Canada has seen continued immigration from many lands during the last four decades and managers aremanaging an increasingly diverse work force. Diversity in the work force can be positive if utilized andchannelled properly. As research shows, diversity can enhance organizational effectiveness and culture.However, there are number of barriers that should be handled appropriately in order to reap themaximum out of diversity initiatives. It is recommended that diversity initiatives be taken slowly, sincethey involve complex change processes. There may be resistance from the existing workforce which willhave to be overcome. Stereotyped beliefs and prejudices can surface, creating resentment.Therefore it is important for any organization that is undertaking diversity initiatives to have topmanagement commitment, training, inclusive representation and communication, support andmentoring programs/groups, regular audits and defined management responsibilities andaccountabilities.80)What steps should an employer use to design an employment equity program and ensure success?Answer:Employment equity programs are designed to achieve a balanced representation of designated groupmembers in the organization. It is a major management exercise because existing employees must becomfortable with other from diverse backgrounds, cultures, religions, etc. The following are the key stepsto follow when designing a program:1. Obtaining senior management commitment and support–a written policy endorsed by seniormanagement should be posted throughout the organization or distributed to all employees.2. Data collection and analysis–this permits the organization to develop an internal work force profile.3. Employment systems review–a comprehensive examination of existing policies, procedures, practices,etc., to determine their impact on designated group members, so that existing intentional and systemicbarriers can be eliminated.4. Plan development–setting of goals and timetable.5. Implementation.6. Monitoring, evaluating and revising.81)What are prohibited grounds of discrimination.Answer:Human rights legislation prohibits discrimination against all Canadians in a number of areas, includingemployment. These areas are known as prohibited grounds of discrimination. These grounds changeacross provinces and territories. However, all jurisdictions prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race,colour, religion/creed, sex, marital status, age, physical and mental disability and sexual orientation.Some but not all jurisdictions prohibit discrimination on the basis of national or ethnic origin, familystatus, ancestry or place of origin and various other grounds.2482)Differentiate between intentional and unintentional discrimination.Answer:Intentional discrimination involves the deliberate use of criteria such as race, religion, or otherprohibited grounds when making employment decisions. It can be direct, indirect, in the form ofdifferential treatment, or on the basis of association. Deliberate discrimination does not have to be overt(blatant).Unintentional discrimination, also known as systemic and constructive discrimination, is difficult todetect and combat. Typically, it is embedded in policies and practices that, although appearing neutral onthe surface and being implemented impartially, have adverse impact on specific groups of people forreasons that are not job related or required for the safe and efficient operation of the business.83)Discuss the four designated groups and differential treatment by employers during employment.Answer:The four designated groups are: women, visible minorities, aboriginal people and people withdisabilities. Differential treatment by employers include lower pay on average, occupational segregation,higher rates of unemployment, underemployment and concentration in low-status jobs with littlepotential for career growth.For example, women are still not represented adequately in senior management positions, though theymake up more than one-half of the Canadian workforce. Similarly, visible minorities also experiencesimilar issues in terms of occupational segregation. Many immigrants are highly educated visibleminorities. They are typically unable to obtain employment that makes full use of their knowledge, skillsand abilities, which is called underemployment. The income of people with disabilities is much lowerthan that of other Canadian workers. Aboriginals are concentrated in three occupational groups: clerical,skilled crafts and trade, and semi-skilled manual work.25
