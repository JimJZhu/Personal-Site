Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.76)Job analysis is called the cornerstone of HRM. Discuss.Answer:Job analysis is the procedure for determining the tasks, duties and responsibilities of each job and thehuman attributes required to perform the job. Job analysis information is used to develop job descriptionsand job specifications. In addition, it is also used for a number of interrelated HRM activities such as HRplanning, recruitment and selection, training and development, career management, compensation andperformance appraisals.For example, knowing the actual requirements of jobs is essential for planning future staffing needs. Jobdescriptions and job specifications are used to decide what sort of person to recruit and hire. Job analysisinformation is used to determine the relative value of jobs in the organization and appropriatecompensation levels. By comparing the knowledge, abilities and skills that employees bring to the jobwith those that are identified by job analysis, managers can determine the gaps that need to be addressedthrough training and development.As you can see, job analysis information is used for a variety of HRM activities and can be called thecornerstone of HRM.77)Discuss human rights legislative requirements pertaining to job descriptions and specifications.Answer:Job Descriptions: Human rights legislation requires employers to ensure that there is no discriminationon any of the prohibited grounds in any aspect or terms and conditions of employment. To ensure thatjob descriptions comply with this legislation, the following points should be kept in mind:· Job descriptions are NOT legally required, but are highly advisable.· Essential job duties should be clearly identified in the job description. Indicating the percentage of timespent on each duty and/or listing duties in order of importance are strategies used to differentiatebetween essential and nonessential tasks and responsibilities.· When assessing suitability for employment, training program enrolment, and transfers or promotions;and when appraising performance, the only criteria examined should be knowledge, skills and abilitiesrequired by the essential duties of the job.· Even when an employee cannot perform one or more of the essential duties due to reasons related to aprohibited ground, such as physical disability or religion, reasonable accommodation to the point ofundue hardship is required.Job Specifications: To comply with human rights legislation, a few key points should be kept in mind:· All listed qualifications must be justifiable, based on the current job duties and responsibilities.· Unjustifiably high educational and/or lengthy experience requirements can lead to systemicdiscrimination. For that reason, many employers are no longer indicating that a degree or diploma ismandatory; rather, they specify that the position calls for a university degree in a specific area, a collegediploma in that area, or an equivalent combination of education and work experience.· The qualifications of the current incumbent should not be confused with the minimum requirements,since he or she might be under- or overqualified.· Identifying the human requirements using a statistical approach is more legally defensible than using ajudgmental approach.2278)Discuss the role of industrial engineering.Answer:Industrial engineering is concerned with analyzing work methods and establishing time standards toimprove efficiency. Industrial engineers systematically identify, analyze, and time the elements of eachjob's work cycle and determine which, if any, elements can be modified, combined, rearranged, oreliminated to reduce the time needed to complete the cycle.To establish time standards, industrial engineers measure and record the time required to complete eachelement in the work cycle, using a stopwatch or work sampling techniques, and then combine these timesto determine the total. Adjustments are then made to compensate for differences in skill level, breaks, andinterruptions due to such factors as machine maintenance or breakdown. The adjusted time becomes thestandard time for that particular work cycle, which serves as an objective basis for evaluating andimproving employee performance and determining incentive pay.Since jobs are created primarily to enable an organization to achieve its objectives, industrial engineeringcannot be ignored as a disciplined and objective approach to job design. However, too much emphasis onthe concerns of industrial engineering–improving efficiency and simplifying work methods–may resultin human considerations being neglected or downplayed What may be improvements in job design andefficiency from an engineering standpoint can sometimes prove to be physiologically or psychologicallyunsound Thus, to be effective, job design must also provide for the satisfaction of human psychologicaland physiological needs.79)Discuss the changing nature of jobs. What factors are driving the change, and what are its implications for thefuture?Answer:The traditional meaning of a "job" as a set of well-defined responsibilities is changing. This is a result ofreduced hierarchical structure in organizations, work being done in teams, more focus on organizationalgoals rather than on rules, and continual change. The focus becomes defining the job at hand for theoverall benefit of the organization, and employees are increasingly expected to adapt to such changes. Asa result of these changes work has become more cognitively complex, more team based, more dependenton social skills and on technological skills. As a result some organizations are focusing on personalcompetencies and skills rather than on specific tasks and responsibilities. More firms are moving towardnew organizational structures built around jobs that are broad and that may change on a daily basis. Insuch situations workers no longer take their cues from job descriptions or supervisor instructions butrather from signals coming from the changing demands of the job at hand.80)Discuss types of organizational structures. What would you recommend as an organizational structure for acompany in retail business and why?Answer:Organizational structure refers to the formal relationships among jobs in an organization. There are threetypes of organizational structure: bureaucratic, flat and boundaryless. Structure of an organizationdepends on the company's strategic goals.Retail organizations typically have flat organizational structures. This is because the emphasis of a retailorganization would be on teams and customer service. Therefore, more authority and autonomy has to bepassed down to teams and line managers, which depict a decentralized management style. Since thecompetitive advantage of the company is based on the quality and speed of customer service, theorganization requires a flat structure to make faster decisions to resolve customer-centred problems. Jobare broadly defined with general job descriptions with the goals of striving for higher levels of customerservice rather than specializing in particular tasks and aspects of a job.2381)List and describe the steps involved in job analysis.Answer:Step One:Identify the use to which the information will be put, since this will determine the types ofdata that should be collected and the techniques used.Step Two: Review relevant background information, such as organization charts, process charts, and jobdescriptions.Step Three: Select the representative positions and jobs to be analyzed This is necessary when there aremany incumbents in a single job and when a number of similar jobs are to be analyzed, since it would betoo time consuming to analyze every position and job.Step Four: Analyze the jobs by collecting data on the job activities, required employee behaviours,working conditions, and human traits and abilities needed to perform the job.Step Five: Review the information with the worker(s) performing the job and with the immediatesupervisor. This will help to confirm that the information is factually correct and complete by providingan opportunity for review and modification, if necessary, this step can also help gain employees'acceptance of job analysis data, as well as the documents derived from this data and subsequentdecisions reached.Step Six: Develop a job description and job specification.82)Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the observation method versus the questionnaire method incollecting job analysis information.Answer:Direct observation is mostly useful when jobs consist mainly of observable physical activities, e.g., anassembly line worker. Third parties are used to conduct observations. This gives more credibility to thedata gathered through observations, unlike using job incumbents who may have reasons for distortinginformation. It's more focused on reality rather than on perceptions, since observations are done whilethe incumbent is performing the job. However, this method is not useful if the job entails a lot of mentalactivity which cannot be observed. It is also not useful if the employee engages in key activities thatmight occur occasionally. Observation can also influence the behaviour of job incumbents.Thequestionnaire method requests employees to fill out questionnaires to describe their job-relatedduties and responsibilities. Questionnaires can be structured or unstructured. In a structuredquestionnaire, job incumbents and supervisors are asked questions about work performed using fixedresponses, whereas unstructured questionnaires request incumbents and supervisors to write essays todescribe work performed. This method is relatively inexpensive and is very useful if covering largenumbers of employees or if the employees are scattered. Structured questionnaires can be easily analyzedusing the computer. However, developing and testing the questionnaires can be time consuming andcostly. It does not allow for probing and tends to focus on perceptions of the job. Responses depend onthe communication skills of the respondents.24
